Price discrimination is a technique for charging certain people more  Nivi: Are there any other microeconomic concepts, outside of zero marginal cost of replication and scale economies (  ) , that are important to understand?  Naval: Price discrimination is important. It means you can charge people based on their propensity to pay.  Now, you can’t charge people different amounts just because you don’t like them. You have to offer them something extra. But it has to be something rich people care about.

Post   : Pre-Tax Compounding Beats Post-Tax Compounding URL    :  Posted : July 17, 2019 at 5:13 pm Author : naval  Podcast: Apple (  )  · Spotify (  )  · Overcast (  )  · Download (  )  We all know compounding is a powerful force, but there are nuances.  Pre-tax compounding is more powerful than post-tax compounding  Nivi: Earlier, we talked about compound interest (  ) , but we didn’t dig into it much.  Naval: The interesting insight here is not that compounding is powerful.  Anyone who’s familiar with the parable of rice doubling on a chessboard—where there is one grain of rice on the first square and two on the second and three on the third, and pretty soon you run out of atoms in the universe to even count how high you’ve gotten—knows compound interest can be a powerful force. But there are nuances.  Read more of this post (  )  Add a comment to this post:   --    Manage Subscriptions   Unsubscribe:

Having trouble viewing this e-mailer? Click here > Visit us on  | July 08, 2019 SECTOR UPDATE Q1FY2020 Banking and NBFCs results preview Private banks to lead, NBFCs remain under pressure While most banks are likely to see improvement in their core operating performance, challenges for NBFCs expected to continue. While growth is likely to be relatively soft in (weaker) NBFCs and PSU Banks, we expect advances momentum to be near-normal for strong NBFCs and retail private banks. Corporate banks should continue to see improvement in core fundamentals with strengthening of balance sheet.  While NIMs of private banks are expected to be stable, slowing growth of NBFCs’ and weak asset book of PSU Banks’ are likely to keep their profitability under pressure. Read more ? Q1FY2020 Consumer Goods results preview Another muted quarter Revenue growth of consumer goods companies to moderate to 8.6% y-o-y due to slowdown in rural demand as compared  to 10.5% and 12.3% growth in Q4FY2019 and Q3FY2019, respectively. Lower volume growth, volatile input prices and higher media spends will put pressure on the margins of few companies, barring companies such as HUL and Marico. Better monsoon in the coming months could be key for revival in consumer demand (especially in rural markets). Our preferred picks are HUL, Britannia Industries, Marico and Varun Beverages. Read more ? Q1FY2020 Capital Goods & Engineering results preview Descent Quarter despite headwinds We expect our capital goods universe to report 22% y-o-y growth in net earnings, led by 11% y-o-y growth in net revenue along with stable to marginal improvement in OPM due to operating leverage and muted commodity prices for Q1FY2020. Order inflow is expected to remain tepid during H1FY2020, maintaining the weakness felt during H2FY2019 due to slowdown related to elections. We maintain our Positive stance on the sector owing to healthy order backlog, expectation of revi val in government spending, gradual revival expected in private capex and healthy outlook on international tendering. Preferred picks: L&T, KEC International, Kalpataru Power Transmission and JMC Projects, Havells  and Polycab. Read more ?

Click here > Visit us on  | July 08, 2019 SECTOR UPDATE Q1FY2020 Banking and NBFCs results preview Private banks to lead, NBFCs remain under pressure While most banks are likely to see improvement in their core operating performance, challenges for NBFCs expected to continue. While growth is likely to be relatively soft in (weaker) NBFCs and PSU Banks, we expect advances momentum to be near-normal for strong NBFCs and retail private banks. Corporate banks should continue to see improvement in core fundamentals with strengthening of balance sheet.  While NIMs of private banks are expected to be stable, slowing growth of NBFCs’ and weak asset book of PSU Banks’ are likely to keep their profitability under pressure. Read more ? Q1FY2020 Consumer Goods results preview Another muted quarter Revenue growth of consumer goods companies to moderate to 8.6% y-o-y due to slowdown in rural demand as compared  to 10.5% and 12.3% growth in Q4FY2019 and Q3FY2019, respectively. Lower volume growth, volatile input prices and higher media spends will put pressure on the margins of few companies, barring companies such as HUL and Marico. Better monsoon in the coming months could be key for revival in consumer demand (especially in rural markets). Our preferred picks are HUL, Britannia Industries, Marico and Varun Beverages. Read more ? Q1FY2020 Capital Goods & Engineering results preview Descent Quarter despite headwinds We expect our capital goods universe to report 22% y-o-y growth in net earnings, led by 11% y-o-y growth in net revenue along with stable to marginal improvement in OPM due to operating leverage and muted commodity prices for Q1FY2020. Order inflow is expected to remain tepid during H1FY2020, maintaining the weakness felt during H2FY2019 due to slowdown related to elections. We maintain our Positive stance on the sector owing to healthy order backlog, expectation of revi val in government spending, gradual revival expected in private capex and healthy outlook on international tendering. Preferred picks: L&T, KEC International, Kalpataru Power Transmission and JMC Projects, Havells  and Polycab. Read more ?

Equity Market Outlook Indian equity indices rallied to a new record high in May 2019 following the ruling coalition's sweeping win in the general elections. S&P BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 touched intra-day record highs of 40,125 points and 12,041 points, respectively, on May 23, 2019 (election  result day). Majority of the S&P BSE sectoral indices ended higher in May 2019. A sharp rally was seen in capital goods, realty, finance and banking counters. Domestic cyclicals - Industrials and Financials - outperformed in May, given the improved policy environment following  election results. Healthcare, IT and Discretionary were key laggards, the former impacted by trade tensions and the latter due to weak sales data. To mitigate the market volatility, we recommend investors to take exposure in Dynamic Asset Allocation schemes that can manage equity  levels based on the market valuations. Also, the valuations disconnect between growth and value stocks can be played through Value and special situations theme. Equity accumulation, in mid- and small-caps, should be done in a staggered manner via SIP/STP. Click here for detailed Equity Update Fixed Income Outlook The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut policy rates by 25bps to 5.75%, in line with market consensus. This is the third consecutive rate cut of CY2019 resulting in a cumulative 75bps of cuts so far. The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee's (MPC) decision to lower rates was brought on by continued low CPI inflation (2.46% averaging Jan-April 2019) and due to concerns around slowdown in growth, investment activity and consumption. Our framework signals that accrual schemes have moved into 'buy' territory with attractive valuations (spread between repo rate), reduced flows, and negative sentiments (NBFC liquidity crunch). We continue to remain sanguine towards the short end o f the yield curve and on spread assets. We believe that the risk-reward benefit is still  favourable in the 1-4 Year segment of the yield curve and spread assets provide better margin of safety. We would recommend short duration schemes that could mitigate interest rate volatility, accrual schemes that provide better carry, and dynamic duration schemes that are flexible  enough to benefit out of interest rate volatility.

Equity Market Outlook Indian equity indices rallied to a new record high in May 2019 following the ruling coalition's sweeping win in the general elections. S&P BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 touched intra-day record highs of 40,125 points and 12,041 points, respectively, on May 23, 2019 (election  result day). Majority of the S&P BSE sectoral indices ended higher in May 2019. A sharp rally was seen in capital goods, realty, finance and banking counters. Domestic cyclicals - Industrials and Financials - outperformed in May, given the improved policy environment following  election results. Healthcare, IT and Discretionary were key laggards, the former impacted by trade tensions and the latter due to weak sales data. To mitigate the market volatility, we recommend investors to take exposure in Dynamic Asset Allocation schemes that can manage equity  levels based on the market valuations. Also, the valuations disconnect between growth and value stocks can be played through Value and special situations theme. Equity accumulation, in mid- and small-caps, should be done in a staggered manner via SIP/STP. Click here for detailed Equity Update Fixed Income Outlook The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut policy rates by 25bps to 5.75%, in line with market consensus. This is the third consecutive rate cut of CY2019 resulting in a cumulative 75bps of cuts so far. The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee's (MPC) decision to lower rates was brought on by continued low CPI inflation (2.46% averaging Jan-April 2019) and due to concerns around slowdown in growth, investment activity and consumption. Our framework signals that accrual schemes have moved into 'buy' territory with attractive valuations (spread between repo rate), reduced flows, and negative sentiments (NBFC liquidity crunch). We continue to remain sanguine towards the short end o f the yield curve and on spread assets. We believe that the risk-reward benefit is still  favourable in the 1-4 Year segment of the yield curve and spread assets provide better margin of safety. We would recommend short duration schemes that could mitigate interest rate volatility, accrual schemes that provide better carry, and dynamic duration schemes that are flexible  enough to benefit out of interest rate volatility.

Equity Market Outlook Indian equity indices remained in the positive terrain for the second consecutive month in April 2019. Benchmarks S&P BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 rose 0.93% and 1.07%, respectively. Hopes of a rate cut over a near normal monsoon forecast and strong buying by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) also boosted sentiments. Encouraging quarterly results from some major domestic companies augured well for the local indices. Going forward, the uncertainty in markets is likely to prevail due to: a) Increased proximity to the outcome of the General Elections b) Impact on MSCI India index due to MSCI China A share expected weight increase  in the semiannual index review on May 15th c) Inflation risk due to potential El Nino effect on the monsoon d) Volatility in Oil prices e) Muted seasonality of FPI flows in the Q1 of the new financial year. We remain neutral on equities and recommend investors to give prime importance to asset allocation with adequate exposure to Debt. Click here for detailed Equity Update Fixed Income Outlook The Benchmark 10-Year Gsec yield closed at 7.41% up by 6 bps based on month end values. This upward movement of yields clearly highlights that, in addition to the rate cut, market was anticipating a change in the policy stance. The rupee weakened against the US dollar in April, with the exchange rate  settling at Rs 69.56 per dollar on April 30. The rupee also received some support after the central bank's forex swap auction conducted towards the end of the month which saw better-than-expected demand. Going forward,  we believe the next rate cut would be data-dependent as the RBI may want to see certain risks play out such as the outcome of the ongoing general elections, uncertainty in oil prices, probability of El Nino effects in 2019 and the Budget to be presented post elections. At this juncture, a series of rate cut looks challenging as the best of food deflation is behind us. From the strategy point of view, we continue to remain sanguine towards the short end of the yield curve and on spread assets.

Equity Market Outlook Indian equities rose by 7.8% during the month of March 2019 on the back of easing inflation giving rise to expectation of lower interest rates, strengthening rupee and record foreign investor flows. Market sentiments turned positive post the recent opinion polls and expectations  of better earnings as companies are expected to report improving topline and bottom-line numbers. Foreign investors invested nearly Rs. 34,000 Crores in Indian equity markets as Central Banks of Developed Markets turned cautious and delayed rate hike decisions on the back of global growth concerns. We maintain our neutral stance and would like to remain nimble footed as valuations are not cheap and many macro and political events unfold over the coming few months. Some of these events could be – an on-going debate around global slowdown, monetary policy actions of global central banks, global trade tensions, and national elections in India. Click here for detailed Equity Update Fixed Income Outlook In the fixed income space, we remain nimble-footed and sanguine towards the short end of the yield curve. We continue to believe that the risk-reward benefit is still favourable in the 1-3 Year segment of the yield curve. We may tactically alter duration based on the spread opportu nity available  in different market segments. What is making us cautious on the longer end of the yield curve is the possibility of fiscal stress due to a shortfall in GST collection, best of food deflation being behind us, heavy borrowing calendar for the first half of the year and RBI’s new liquidity tool facility pointing towards reduced OMO operations. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut policy rates by 25bps to 6%, in line with market consensus. This is the second rate cut of 2019 resulting in a cumulative 50bps cut so far. We remain watchful of any fiscal slippages, reversal in prices of any perishable food items, uncertainty regarding global events and escalating trade tensions between US and China. We would recommend short duration schemes which could mitigate interest rate volatility, accrual schemes which provide better carry and dynamic duration schemes which are flexible enough to benefit out of interest rate volatility.

Equity Market Outlook Indian equities ended a very volatile month of February down 1.1% from the previous month on account of the Interim Budget, a pre-emptive military strike by India, slow recovery in earnings growth over the last two quarters, buzz around general elections, and receding tensions between US and China. Even though earnings for Q3FY19 were in-line with expectations, earnings growth is expected to pick up going forward. The recovery could be primarily led by some of the leading names in the banking sector shedding some of the NPA-baggage, pharma companies benefitting from revival in US generic revenues,  and relatively strong growth in companies of the consumption sector. Globally, markets remained watchful of the US Federal Reserve’s stance to pause rate hikes for now and signal flexibility in the rate-hike process. Further, smoothening out of tensions between US and China,  slowing growth in the Chinese economy also kept markets worried. Click here for detailed Equity Update Fixed Income Outlook In keeping with our equity outlook, we would like to be nimble footed in the fixed income space as well. As there are a lot of global and domestic macros and triggers at play, we believe the short end of the yield curve (1-3 Years) provides the better risk-adjusted returns. We remain cautious on the longer end of the curve, as fiscal concerns continue due to the central government’s shortfall from GST collection, a key reason for fiscal slippage. Also, tightening liquidity in the system has forced the RBI to conduct OMOs, which has distorted the yield  curve by driving down yields. We believe that global events, domestic fiscal stress, alongwith RBI not being present in a big way for absorbing the over-supply of bonds may pave the way for higher volatility thereby justifying our strategy to remain cautious and invested in the short  duration space.

Equity Market Outlook Indian equities ended a very volatile month of February down 1.1% from the previous month on account of the Interim Budget, a pre-emptive military strike by India, slow recovery in earnings growth over the last two quarters, buzz around general elections, and receding tensions between US and China. Even though earnings for Q3FY19 were in-line with expectations, earnings growth is expected to pick up going forward. The recovery could be primarily led by some of the leading names in the banking sector shedding some of the NPA-baggage, pharma companies benefitting from revival in US generic revenues,  and relatively strong growth in companies of the consumption sector. Globally, markets remained watchful of the US Federal Reserve’s stance to pause rate hikes for now and signal flexibility in the rate-hike process. Further, smoothening out of tensions between US and China,  slowing growth in the Chinese economy also kept markets worried. Click here for detailed Equity Update Fixed Income Outlook In keeping with our equity outlook, we would like to be nimble footed in the fixed income space as well. As there are a lot of global and domestic macros and triggers at play, we believe the short end of the yield curve (1-3 Years) provides the better risk-adjusted returns. We remain cautious on the longer end of the curve, as fiscal concerns continue due to the central government’s shortfall from GST collection, a key reason for fiscal slippage. Also, tightening liquidity in the system has forced the RBI to conduct OMOs, which has distorted the yield  curve by driving down yields. We believe that global events, domestic fiscal stress, alongwith RBI not being present in a big way for absorbing the over-supply of bonds may pave the way for higher volatility thereby justifying our strategy to remain cautious and invested in the short  duration space.

Hi,  At Floh we maintain a gender balance in each age category. To regularly maintain this balance, we sometimes have to defer sending out an invitation for a brief period. That is the reason why your membership is on hold and we will not be able to complete your membership process immediately.  We will contact you as soon as the gender balance has been equalized.  Best Wishes,  Anushree Membership Team, Floh
